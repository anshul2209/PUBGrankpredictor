BattleGrounds
=============

PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds (PUBG) is an online multiplayer battle
royale game which has enjoyed massive popularity. With over 50 million
copies sold it's the fifth best selling game of all time and has
millions of active monthly players.

This demonstration, based on Anshul Bansal's
[notebook](https://notebooks.azure.com/user2209/libraries/pubgRankPredict),
explores a publicly available dataset with the aim to predict if a
player would make it to the top 10 position in the game. Based on the
player's after game statistics, the model is able to predict the
player position. Such results could be published on an online portal
or in media prior to any tournaments happening for cash prizes.

What's the best strategy to be in the top ten positions in PUBG?
Should you sit in one spot and hide your way into victory, or do you
need to be the top shot? Let's see if the data might tell us.
